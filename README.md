# Template10Test
Application made as a project for university.
This application is written in C# using UWP.
The app allows user to add twitch.tv streamers to watch, and user will be notified if the streamer is online. Also allows to import watch list from twitch.tv account.
By logging in user gets access to second part of the application, which is saving league of legends builds using my own webapi using riotgames api and twitch.tv token to authenticate user.
Webapi is made in C# WebApi.
Displaying saved data from league of legends is not yet implemented.
